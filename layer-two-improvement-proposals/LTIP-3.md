| LTIP-3 | L2StateOfMind NFT Holder Vote #1 | Pending | Weston (westonnelson), Exosphere (@exosphereL2), Train (@layer2train) | L2StateOfMind NFT Holders Participate In Governance On Snapshot To Partner With Thales Protocol | https://discord.gg/layer2dao | 2022-09-01
 
# Summary

This LTIP proposes to the Layer2DAO community a vote conducted on Snapshot to signal support for the first L2StateOfMind project (Evolved from the original plans around the OPIncupator idea) - to support and partner with Thales Protocol. The vote will be conducted via Snapshot, and signifies the first project for that L2DAO will be indirectly supporting via $OP token transfer and also partnership amongst the two DAOs. Thourough research of the current Optimism L2 landscape has identified several good candidates for L2DAO to select from, but Thales Protocol has been espcially identified as a high-impact project for the L2 ecosystem that has demonstrated leadership in the L2 space and has also demonstrated what the L2DAO believes has the potential of continuing this leadership they have already demonstrated. The Proposal would entail supporting Thales Protocol with 27,500 $OP tokens and a token swap between the two DAOs, Layer2DAO, and Thales DAO, to align both protocol's interests over the long-term. 

# Abstract

The L2DAO is about leadership in the Layer2 space and also enabling other protocols to thrive. This vote is in alignment with the overall vision and roadmap of many of the several initiatives the DAO is working on, but specifically, this kickstarts the emphasis of what was originally thought of several monnths ago as a unique way to show support and foster L2 adoption, and we believe this will work as a catalyst for onboarding more users to the Layer2 ecosystem. Important and unique to note about this vote: The criteria to be eligible to vote is you *must* hold an L2StateOfMind NFT as of the Snapshot proposal to vote, and *every* single voting address will be sent 25 $OP tokens as a gesture of the L2DAO's appreciation for engagement in Web3 governance. The NFT that is required to be eligible to vote can be found on-chain at [Optimistic Etherscan](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x66deb6cc4d65dc9cb02875dc5e8751d71fa5d50e)

# Background:

L2DAO is the Layer2DAO governance token which was [launched](https://docs.layer2dao.org/airdrop) 8 months ago. The DAO has launched several products that are producing ongoing revenues, such as .L2 domain sales, LP positions, and resale commissions of the L2 early adopter NFT series, with other revenue generating projects, such as the new NFT Collection launched, and also many DAO to DAO partnerships yet to be announced...that will serve as sources of potential revenue in the pipeline. .L2 domains in particular have tremendous growth potential as a direct competitor to ENS, as well as Ethereum Node Operation. 

# Implementation:

If LTIP-3 is approved, Layer2DAO will collaborate and support Thales Protocol to encourage their continued success by sending 27,500 $OP tokens to the Thales DAO Multisig for them to use for continue onboarding of users to L2.

Layer2DAO and Thales Protocol will execute a token swap to form a partnership and support each others growth over the long-term.
