| LTIP-11 | Expand L2DAO token to zkSync Era | Pending | Exosphere (@exosphereL2) | Set up canonical token for L2DAO on zkSync Era | https://discord.gg/layer2dao | 2023-04-07
 
## Summary

This LTIP proposes to that Layer2DAO expand its operations to zkSync Era by setting up a canonical token on that chain and begin engaging with partner projects on zkSync.

## Abstract

Layer2DAO is about leadership in the Ethereum Layer2 space and bringing visibility to L2 projects and chains. This vote is in alignment with the overall vision and roadmap of Layer2DAO to expand to new L2 chains and participate in the ecosystem. The team will create the canonical L2DAO token contract for zkSync Era and deploy it on the chain. This will allow us to begin partnerships on the chain that involve our token.

Voting will take place using xL2DAO (locked L2DAO on Arbitrum).

## Implementation:

If LTIP-11 is approved, Layer2DAO will initiate the following steps:
* Create canonical L2DAO token contract for zkSync Era
* Deploy token to testnet, followed by mainnet
* Submit token on block explorer
* Enable token on bridges
* Bridge 25,000,000 L2DAO tokens (2.5% of supply) from the DAO treasury to zkSync Era, with the option to bridge up to 100,000,000 L2DAO tokens (10% of supply) if the use cases exist
* Initiate partnerships with projects on chain

### Dependencies
There are several dependencies on zkSync that need to be met to complete the implementation. These include, but are not exclusive to:
* Gnosis Safe support
* Bridge support
* No unexpected security issues
