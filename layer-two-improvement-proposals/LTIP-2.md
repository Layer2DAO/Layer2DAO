| LTIP-2 | Implement Revenue Sharing Plan| Draft | Exosphere (@exosphereL2) | Allow staking L2DAO for share of DAO revenues | https://discord.gg/PTKzgswQRX | 2022-07-22
 
## Summary
 
This LTIP proposes to add a revenue sharing program, allowing L2DAO token holders to earn a share in DAO revenues.
 
 ## Abstract

The original roadmap for Layer2DAO had us reinvesting all revenues into future growth, but recent developments in the DeFi/DAO space (bear market, headwinds for governance tokens, popularity of income generation) have us rethinking our medium-term strategy for growing the DAO.

The DAO has launched several products that are starting to produce ongoing revenues, such as .L2 domain sales and resale commissions of the L2 early adopter NFT series, with other revenue generating projects, such as the OPIncubator, in the pipeline. .L2 domains in particular have tremendous growth potential as a direct competitor to ENS.

The Layer2DAO team is proposing that we reward long-term holders of L2DAO tokens by paying out a part of DAO revenues (up to 50%) to token holders on a regular basis. Token holders will need to stake and lock up their tokens in order to participate in revenue sharing. Stakers can withdraw their accumulated share of revenues at any time via the staking UI. 

We anticipate future votes to determine which Layer2DAO initiatives to include in this program, and to decide on other details in order to launch the program.

Eventually we can also see us implementing the option to automatically reinvest any shared revenues into more L2DAO tokens in order to compound revenues. This would also create ongoing buying pressure on the L2DAO token. LooksRare implemented similar functionality for their revenue sharing program.

In favor of implementing revenue sharing program:
* Reward long-term holders / DAO members
* Increase interest in DAO participation
* Provides token purpose aside from governance

In favor of not implementing revenue sharing program:
* DAO treasury builds faster
* Larger budgets to build on existing investments (marketing for .L2 domains, etc)
* Allows reinvesting more revenues into future investments

L2DAO voters will receive a POAP for participating in this LTIP vote.

## Implementation

If LTIP-2 is approved, the Layer2DAO team will begin developing the smart contracts and staking UI.
